 â€œVehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in a College Campus using Edge-AI"
Objective:

The main goal of this project is to create an Edge AI-based solution that can analyze vehicle movement in and out of a college campus. This will be done using data from cameras that capture vehicle photos and license plates. The solution aims to provide insights into vehicle movement patterns, parking occupancy, and matching vehicles to an approved vehicle database.

## Problem Description:
Managing vehicle movement and parking in a college campus can be a challenging task. An intelligent system that can analyze vehicle movement, monitor parking occupancy, and match vehicles to an approved database can significantly improve campus security and management.
Vehicle Movement Patterns: Analyze the frequency and timing of vehicle movement in and out of the campus, identifying peak times and patterns.
Parking Occupancy: Monitor the occupancy of parking lots in real-time, identifying which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times.
Vehicle Matching: Match captured vehicle images and license plates to an approved vehicle database to identify unauthorized vehicles.
